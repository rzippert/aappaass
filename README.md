Manages "passthrough" sinks for PulseAudio.

## Details

Using pulseaudio, directs the output from a process to a sink and attaches monitors to this sink so that it can be heard through all possible devices, as well as recorded with OBS. This makes it easy to record the audio of a single application with OBS while still hearing its output on linux systems.
